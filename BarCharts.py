# Here, we use plt.bar() function to plot a bar chart.
# x-coordinates of left side of bars are passed along with heights of bars.
# you can also give some name to x-axis coordinates by defining tick_labels

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# x-coordinates of left sides of bars
left = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# heights of bars
height = [10, 24, 36, 40, 5]

# labels for bars
tick_label = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five']

# plotting a bar chart
plt.bar(left, height, tick_label = tick_label,
		width = 0.8, color = ['red', 'green'])

# naming the x-axis
plt.xlabel('x - axis')
# naming the y-axis
plt.ylabel('y - axis')
# plot title
plt.title('My bar chart!')

# function to show the plot
plt.show()
